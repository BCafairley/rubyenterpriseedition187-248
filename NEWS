  * Tk::X_Scrollable (Y_Scrollable) is renamed to Tk::XScrollable

    but it is an alias name.

  * Support --without-X11 configure option for non-X11 versions of
    Tcl/Tk (e.g. Tcl/Tk Aqua).

  * New sample script: irbtkw.rbw -- IRB on Ruby/Tk. It has no trouble

=== New methods and features

  * New method: Kernel#instance_variable_defined?

  * New method: Module#class_variable_defined?

  * New feature: Dir::glob() can now take an array of glob patterns.

    digest_length (alias size or length), block_length()

  * New library: digest/bubblebabble

  * New function: Digest(name)

* fileutils

  * New option for FileUtils.cp_r(): :remove_destination

* thread

  * Replaced with much faster mutex implementation in C.  The former
    implementation, which is slow but considered to be stable, is
    available with a configure option `--disable-fastthread'.

* webrick

  * New method: WEBrick::Cookie.parse_set_cookies()

=== Compatibility issues (excluding feature bug fixes)

* builtin classes

  * String#intern now raises SecurityError when $SAFE level is greater
    than zero.

* date

  * Time#to_date and Time#to_datetime are added as private methods.
    They cause name conflict error in ActiveSupport 1.4.1 and prior,
    which comes with Rails 1.2.2 and prior.  Updating ActiveSupport
    and/or Rails to the latest versions fixes the problem.

* digest

  * The constructor does no longer take an initial string to feed.
    The following examples show how to migrate:

      # Before
      md = Digest::MD5.new("string")
      # After (works with any version)
      md = Digest::MD5.new.update("string")
        
      # Before
      hd = Digest::MD5.new("string").hexdigest
      # After (works with any version)
      hd = Digest::MD5.hexdigest("string")

* fileutils

  * A minor implementation change breaks Rake <=0.7.1.
    Updating Rake to 0.7.2 or higher fixes the problem.
